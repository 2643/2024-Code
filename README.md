## Robot

  2643's 2024 Robot **D-Major** utilizes a swerve drivetrain, flywheel shooter, and LimeLight to pick up and fire notes at rapid speed, and weighs in at just under 100 pounds. It has already been demonstrated to easily accomplish 6-7 cycles without Limelight assisted auto-aim, and is likely able to go even faster. 
  
  Current features include:
  * Swerve Drive
  * Auto Aim
  * Speaker & Amp capable scoring
  * Up to 3 note autonomous routine
